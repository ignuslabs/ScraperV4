Issues Identified

    1. Remaining Stub Implementations (Priority: HIGH)

    Several methods still have stub implementations that need completion:
    - stop_scraping_job() in scraping_service.py (line 283) - only updates 
    status, doesn't cancel async tasks
    - validate_template() in template_service.py - basic validation stub
    - suggest_improvements() in adaptive_selector.py - returns empty 
    suggestions
    - analyze_failure() in adaptive_selector.py - returns mock analysis
    - test_selector_resilience() in template_validator.py - stub 
    implementation

    2. Integration Test Failures (Priority: HIGH)

    All integration tests are failing (8 out of 9 failed). Issues appear to
     be:
    - Mock objects not properly configured
    - Import paths may be incorrect
    - Test fixtures not initializing services correctly

    3. Async Job Cancellation (Priority: MEDIUM)

    The stop_scraping_job() method doesn't actually cancel running async 
    tasks. Need to:
    - Track async tasks in a dictionary
    - Implement proper task cancellation
    - Handle cleanup when jobs are stopped

    4. CSV Export Comments (Priority: LOW)

    The CSV export in data_utils.py still has "stub implementation" comment
     despite being functional

    Implementation Plan

    Phase 1: Fix Critical Functionality

    1. Implement proper job cancellation:
      - Add task tracking to ScrapingService
      - Store asyncio.Task references when jobs start
      - Cancel tasks in stop_scraping_job()
      - Handle CancelledError properly
    2. Complete template validation:
      - Implement real selector validation
      - Check template structure integrity
      - Validate required fields

    Phase 2: Fix Integration Tests

    1. Update test imports and mocks:
      - Fix import paths in test_service_integration.py
      - Properly configure mock objects
      - Add missing test fixtures
    2. Create test database:
      - Set up test template files
      - Create mock job data
      - Initialize test storage

    Phase 3: Complete Stub Methods

    1. Adaptive selector improvements:
      - Implement real selector suggestion logic
      - Add failure analysis with pattern matching
      - Create resilience testing
    2. Template validator enhancements:
      - Implement selector robustness testing
      - Add improvement suggestions based on best practices

    Phase 4: Performance & Optimization

    1. Add connection pooling for scrapers
    2. Implement result caching for frequently accessed data
    3. Add rate limiting per domain
    4. Optimize memory usage for large datasets

    Phase 5: Additional Features

    1. Add health check endpoint for monitoring
    2. Implement job scheduling for recurring scrapes
    3. Add webhook support for job completion notifications
    4. Create admin dashboard for job management

    Files to Modify

    Priority 1 (Critical):

    - src/services/scraping_service.py - Add async task management
    - src/services/template_service.py - Complete validation
    - tests/integration/test_service_integration.py - Fix test failures

    Priority 2 (Important):

    - src/templates/adaptive_selector.py - Implement suggestions
    - src/templates/template_validator.py - Complete validation methods
    - src/utils/data_utils.py - Update comments

    Priority 3 (Enhancement):

    - src/scrapers/base_scraper.py - Add connection pooling
    - src/data/result_storage.py - Add caching layer
    - src/web/api_routes.py - Add health check endpoint

    Debugging Steps

    1. Fix integration tests first to ensure no regressions
    2. Add logging to async job execution for better debugging
    3. Create unit tests for new implementations
    4. Test job cancellation with long-running scrapes
    5. Verify memory usage with large datasets

    Success Criteria

    ✅ All integration tests pass
    ✅ Jobs can be properly cancelled mid-execution
    ✅ Template validation provides meaningful feedback
    ✅ No methods marked as "stub implementation"
    ✅ Performance improvements measurable
    ✅ Application handles edge cases gracefully
